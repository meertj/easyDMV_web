      <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hey there! Welcome to easyDMV, we are a service created to save you time and headaches in finding the right DMV appointment slot for you. </p>
      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>What was the motivation to create easyDMV?</h3>
          <p> Upon moving the North Carolina, I immediately learned that I'd be lucky to find an appointment to get all my documents in order 
          within the next 3 months! The only alternative was to reserve an appointment at a more rural DMV hours away, or get
          in line well before open and hope you get a chance to be seen! </p>
          <p>I spent hours waiting for an appointment at the next town over only to be told I would need to come back again when I realized it would be
          nearly impossible to camp out for a second attempt. I spent the next few weeks watching the skiptheline DMV appointment scheduler trying to 
          find something more concrete. Through the use of a rinky-dink script, I was able to secure and appointment and finally get my new NC resident
          needs taken care of. Since then, I've worked to clean up my script and make it usable for others in my situation. </p>
        <h3> How can I use easyDMV? </h3>
          <p> By providing some basic contact information, your appointment need, and some information on location and how far you're willing to travel,
          easyDMV can find the soonest appointment that meets your needs! No need to wade through the DMV UI or wait in long lines!  </p>
          <p> Soon we will also offer appointment polling, which will keep tabs on any availability that opens up and notify you as soon as it does! </p>
